# Football-Data-Analytics-Dashboard



### Dataset
Event-level football match data (e.g., open-source football event datasets such as StatsBomb / Kaggle match events / public football APIs)

### Tools Used
- SQL
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Tableau

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze football match event data to extract tactical and performance insights, identify patterns in team and player behavior, and support data-driven decision making in match preparation and performance evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions

- Which players and teams perform consistently in key attacking or defensive actions?
- How do different in-match metrics (xG, shots, passes, possession) influence match outcomes?
- Are there identifiable tactical patterns that correlate with successful outcomes?
- How do individual player performance metrics compare relative to team benchmarks?

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   Standardized event data fields, handled missing values, and structured data for analytical workflows.

2. **Team & Player Performance Metrics**  
   Computed metrics such as expected goals (xG), defensive actions, possession impact, and passing efficiency.

3. **SQL-Based Insights**  
   Used SQL queries to aggregate and rank key performance indicators by player, team, match phase, and outcome.

4. **Visual Analytics Dashboards**  
   Created interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to explore performance trends and tactical patterns.

5. **Comparative Analysis**  
   Benchmarked teams and player performance over time and against league averages.

## 📈 Key Insights

- High xG values did not always correspond with higher match wins — indicating potential issues in finishing efficiency.
- Teams with higher possession percentages showed improved control but not necessarily improved scoring frequency.
- Player positioning and defensive action clusters uncovered tactical styles among top-performing teams.
- Certain players exhibited above-average contributions to build-up play or defensive stability.

---

## 🧩 Business / Tactical Recommendations

- **Focus training on finishing efficiency** for players with high xG but low conversion rates.
- **Analyze match phases** with frequent turnovers to improve transitional defense.
- **Use dashboard filters** to identify match situations requiring tactical adjustments.
- **Leverage comparative benchmarks** to scout talent or opposition vulnerabilities.
